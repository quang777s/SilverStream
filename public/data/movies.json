The central motif is formed by the parallels between Havel's life and the successful play Leaving, which Havel always wanted to direct as a film adaptation."},{"title":"Babes","year":"2024","rating":"6.3 / 10","genres":["Comedy"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/babes-2024/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/babes-2024.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt21276958/","description":"After getting pregnant from a one-night stand, a single woman leans on her married best friend and mother of two to guide her through gestation and beyond."},{"title":"Yi dai jian wang","year":"1968","rating":"6.6 / 10","genres":["Action"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/yi-dai-jian-wang-1968/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/yi-dai-jian-wang-1968.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt0978752/","description":"A master swordsman is on a twenty year quest to revenge the death of his parents."},{"title":"Lifeline","year":"1997","rating":"6.7 / 10","genres":["Action","Drama"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/lifeline-1997/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/lifeline-1997.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt0120115/","description":"A heroic but cocky firefighter pays no regard to the dangers of the job but lacks the courage to face his personal demons.

In the 1970s, such \"festivals\" were incredibly popular in Brazil. They were recorded before a live studio audience, and usually featured a number of elimination rounds. They also formed the springboard for the career of many a big-name star, such as Chico Buarque, Caetano Veloso, Roberto Carlos and Gilberto Gil. Appearing on such a program was no cakewalk, however: audiences could be as wild in their condemnation as in their appreciation of an artist. Extensive archive footage (including performances and behind-the-scenes interviews) from a turbulent final of the Festival of Brazilian Popular Music one evening in 1967 paints a fascinating picture, not only of the transformation of Brazilian music into real \"festival\" music, but also of a society starting to buck against the yoke of military rule."},{"title":"The Royal Bengal Tiger","year":"2014","rating":"6.8 / 10","genres":["Thriller"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/the-royal-bengal-tiger-2014/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/the-royal-bengal-tiger-2014.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt3479858/","description":"Abhirup is a typical Bengali guy who has a happy family but he doesn't know how to protest.

With eye-opening footage, revealing interviews, humorous anecdotes, and an array of visual effects, the film categorically explores the alleged usage of subliminals in advertising, music, film, television, anti-theft devices, political propaganda, military psychological operations, and advanced weapons development.

It's story is about a ship called the Spirit of Fire that is protecting one of the outer colonies when they follow a covenant ship that attacks the colony to a unknown planet, with a mysterious past. The story follows the characters Captian Cutter, the commander of the ship, professor Anders, the brainiac scientist, and sgt. forge, the sarcastic leader of the marine ground forces. In the game each character is a playable character in a leadership type roll. Each character has their own abilities and special units they can research and use. For example, sgt. Forge can make \"Grizzleys\" or super tanks. The campaign that takes about 20-30 years before the events on Reach is fun and has good replay value, you can collect skulls for use in \"skirmish\" local matches. The multiplayer is arguably what makes this game the most interesting. Besides Cutter, Forge, and Anders you can play as three covenant leaders. These characters are a little more obscure in their roles in the plot but are just as fun to play as. Unlike the human characters they are actually on the ground and can be controlled. They are the Prophet, the Arbiter and a brute chieftain. Like the humans they have their own abilities two. What makes this fun is how evenly distributed the power is between each of the 6 playable leaders. Each one with their own perks and their own down falls. In skirmish matches any of the leaders can be pitted against eachother to the point where you could have 3 professor Anders vs 3 professor Anders.

The film team is also received by Father Epiphanios - a gifted and poetic cook who certainly does not disdain the pleasures of life."},{"title":"The Final: Attack on Wembley","year":"2024","rating":"6.3 / 10","genres":["Action","Documentary"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/the-final-attack-on-wembley-2024/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/the-final-attack-on-wembley-2024.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt26315566/","description":"As England reach the final of the Euros at last, 6,000 ticketless football fans storm Wembley stadium, leaving destruction in their wake."},{"title":"Paul Chowdhry: Live Innit","year":"2019","rating":"6.7 / 10","genres":["Comedy"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/paul-chowdhry-live-innit-2019/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/paul-chowdhry-live-innit-2019.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt10907772/","description":"Award-winning and record-breaking comedian Paul Chowdhry brings his stand-up special Live Innit to the screen."},{"title":"A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story","year":"1991","rating":"7.1 / 10","genres":["Biography","Drama"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/a-triumph-of-the-heart-the-ricky-bell-story-1991/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/a-triumph-of-the-heart-the-ricky-bell-story-1991.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt0103123/","description":"Ricky Bell, an all-pro running back with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who died of a rare muscle disease in the prime of his career.

Instead, Kelton describes the national debt as simply a historical record of the number of dollars created by the US federal government currently being held in pockets, as assets, by the rest of us.  MMT bursts into the media with journalists asking, “Have we been thinking about how the government spends money, all wrong?” But top economists from across the political spectrum condemn the theory as “voodoo economics”, “crazy” and “a crackpot theory”.  FINDING THE MONEY traces the conflict all the way back to the story we tell about money, injecting new hope and empowering countries around the world to tackle the biggest challenges of the 21st century: from climate change to inequality."},{"title":"Weekend, Italian Style","year":"1965","rating":"6.3 / 10","genres":["Comedy"],"url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/weekend-italian-style-1965/","image_url":"https://wwv.yts-official.mx/movies/poster/weekend-italian-style-1965.jpg","video_source":"https://vidsrc.net/embed/movie/tt0060813/","description":"Manager Marletti goes to the sea to meet his wife Giuliana to spend the weekend with her and many friends.
